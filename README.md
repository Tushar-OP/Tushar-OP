I love coding and it just amazes me even more as I dwell deeper into the unknown lands of technology and would appreciate some nakama(friends). I have passed the dungeons of Assembly, C, C++, Python and various others out of which python is the one for me.<br> Currently I'm in the Flutter lands and looking forward to enter the Mysterious City Of DataScience. Apart from coding and all the technology stuff, I also like to productively(not really) watch Anime! <br>
Wanna talk about my adventures, wanna share yours or just Anime&Chill?</em></b></p>
